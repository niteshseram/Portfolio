### Introduction

No system is entirely immune to vulnerabilities and the same is true with [Blockchain](/blog/intro-web3) and one such concern is the 51% attack. A 51% attack is capable of wreaking havoc on a blockchain network and has the potential to undermine `one of the core principles of blockchain technology: decentralization. In this blog, we will understand what exactly is a 51% attack and how it is prevented in the blockchain network. 

#### The Role of Consensus Algorithm?

Blockchain networks rely on a [consensus algorithm](/blog/consensus-algorithms-building-trust-in-blockchain) to validate transactions and maintain the security and integrity of the system. Consensus algorithms like [Proof of Work (PoW)](/blog/consensus-algorithms-building-trust-in-blockchain#proof-of-work-pow) and [Proof of Stake (PoS)](/blog/consensus-algorithms-building-trust-in-blockchain#proof-of-stake-pos) require nodes to agree on the validity of transactions before adding them to the blockchain. This process ensures that the network remains decentralized and secure from tampering.
